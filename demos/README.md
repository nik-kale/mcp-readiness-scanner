# Demo Files

This directory contains generated demonstration files for the MCP Readiness Scanner.

## Contents

Demo files are generated by scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

- `mcp-readiness-demo.gif` - Animated GIF demonstration (generated by `scripts/generate_demo.sh`)
- `mcp-readiness-demo.svg` - Animated SVG demonstration (generated by `scripts/generate_demo_svg.sh`)

## Generating Demos

To generate demo files:

```bash
# Generate GIF (requires asciinema + agg)
make demo-gif

# OR generate SVG (requires termtosvg)
make demo-svg

# OR run scripts directly
./scripts/generate_demo.sh
./scripts/generate_demo_svg.sh
```

See `scripts/README.md` for detailed instructions and requirements.

## Note

Demo files (`.gif`, `.svg`, `.cast`) are not committed to the repository.
They should be generated locally as needed.
